## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Davisanism is a sect of Christianity with primary influences from Catholic practices stemming from the gnostic-sect of Christian thought with an emphasis on esoteric knowledge seeking.

This is mainly due to the primary innovation of Davisanism, being the use of the Temple Operating System as a means of prayer, worship, ceremony and industry. Davisans use the operating system to make offerings of art, song and code to the Christian God. The operating system can also be used like an Oracle, using a random number generator to speak a Davisan version of speaking in tongues, also known as glossolalia.
